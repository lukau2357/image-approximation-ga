### TODO:
    - Extend README (Hyperparameters for the genetic algorithm, different crossover functions, API examples, ...)
    - Equivalent implementation in C++ (or any other compiled language for that matter) to speed up the algorithm!

Genetic algorithm engine for approximating RBG images with a fixed number of poylgons/ellipses. Approximation of Mona Lisa with 150 polygons, each individual polygon having at most 6 sides (each generation had 200 different polygon configurations) can be seen in the following figure:
